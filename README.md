TODO: find a better name

## Game Idea
Start with one main character that you can control in a dark world with a single light. Do some stuff and befriend some people to expand the influence of the light and get more friends you can play with. At the end escape using the power of friendship or something.

## Desired Elements
* Unlockable characters with stories of their own, characters interact and form relationships
* Some sort of choose-your-own-adventure style interactivity
* Build a base
